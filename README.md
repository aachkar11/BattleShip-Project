# BattleShip-Project
AP CSA final project
Battleship Game (Java)

Ethan and I (Anthony) decided to code battleship for our final project in AP Computer Science A. In order to use the Java code provided in the following files, you must paste it into an IDE and play it with one other person. First one player will place their ships without the other player looking at the screen. There a total of 5 ships with lengths of 2, 3, 4, 5 (2 Ships of 3). After all the ships are placed, the grid is hidden and the other player would do the same. When ready to play, each player will take turns guessing squares from a grid. When all the ships are gone, the game will end, printing out the winner when doing so.
