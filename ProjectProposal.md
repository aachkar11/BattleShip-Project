## Battleship Project Proposal


# Topic: 
	Our project will be based on the childhood board game, battleship. Two players will be able to play against each other on the same screen without being able to see each others ships. 

# Objective:
	Our goal is to learn how to do graphic design and stuff related to visual design while also practicing what we learned from this course. Visual design is not apart of the AP CSA course, however it is a big part of computer science in the real world. 

# Methodology:
	First we will make a version without the visuals, using java programming on replit. We will work together to produce the base code including the classes and methods we will implement. If we can figure out how specifically to make the game first, learning graphic design will be easier. The final version of the game, with graphic design, will not be on replit. It will be on Processing IDE https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/


# Expected outcomes:
	Overall, the end result should be a fully functional game with decent graphics at best. We expect that the code for the game might be challenging to implement,  as 2D arrays and arraylists might be in play. However, when the code is finished, the design wonâ€™t be as hard to get down (other than learning it). But we will still have relatively low standards for the end result.
